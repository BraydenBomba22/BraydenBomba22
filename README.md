## About Me
### My Interests
Some of my interests include: 
* Kickboxing
* Cooking
* Reading

Typically, I am either working through school, at my current job, or one of my listed hobbies. Another big interest of mine is traveling, I have been to multiple states already this year and plan to get out the house as much as possible.
### Websites I Recommend
[HayaBusa Fight Gear](https://www.hayabusafight.com/)

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)

While I'm not usually online as much as I used to be, all of my online shopping and trying to find the best equipment for my hobbies occurs on these two webistes in particular.
